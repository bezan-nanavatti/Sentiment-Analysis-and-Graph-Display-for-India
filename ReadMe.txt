Check the programs and pip install and add path for all the libraries written [most libraries will be mentioned in the setup.py file and they're all related to python libraries]
The UI is simple and made via Tkinter library in python, you can edit it and make it more dynamic or host the features on a website if necessary.
This project might not include all the .csv files that you  may require but check the programs and make them accordingly
I did all the programming using visual studio code editor, and i will also include a .ipynb file for Jupyter for y'all
The files I used for the map plotting and map features are india-polygon with suffixes .shp .shx .cpg .dbf .prj and you will need to download them to plot.
Other .csv files you may need include a training csv, a result csv [for both sentiment analysis and recorded crime rate], and a final plot csv which is the csv to be plotted after you perform your required calculations.
You will also have to add csv and other text files[like positive and negative words, etc] for the project to work
Go through the programs to find out the other files needed, the code will be here.
This was used as a final year project for computer engineering. You can edit it and use it wherever and however you'd like.
finnn.exe is the final file that plots the graph.
If the .exe file cannot be viewed or downloaded you can use the setup.py file to make an exe file of finnn.py through command prompt, you should find an easy tutorial online. [.py to .exe]
I have included a program for a decision tree and multiple options for sentiment analysis if you need it.
The sentiment analysis files and programs work, but you'll need to add the required csv files and you can change them to whatever name you'd like. there's two or three sentiment analysis programs, choose which one you like and edit the csv accordingly.
You might have to add code for calculations within your csv files as per requirement or your preference. ( Good Luck ;)
P.S. The .ipynb files might be in a single kernel unit and not divided, you'll need to split that up, and if you're here, then it should be rather easy to find the right places for the same. I will include a pdf of our project that includes where we submitted it from [our college], abstract, intro, and images, etc. that are needed to explain the project
